- Hi, I’m Mark A Silver.
- I’m interested in data science as it pertains to fintech and cryptocurrency.
- I’m currently learning Python, SQL, Solidity, Web3.js, and Node.js. I use PyCharm, Ganache, Sublimetext, and Heroku to support my studies.
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects that benefit others financially. I am interested in drafting code for exchanges, platforms/UIs, mortgages and loans, insurance (health,   life, etc.), and wills (simple, joint, and living).  
- You can contact me here or on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-s-ab9199211/).
- When I'm not programming and learning to do so, I'm listening to progressive rock and studying Japanese.
